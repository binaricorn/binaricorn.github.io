<p>You take one last look at your room before you leave. Your meager posessions are packed up into two labeled boxes: clothes in one, memorables in the other. You sprint to the bus, even though not supposed to run when the dust level is so high but you have a wet towel covering your mouth, and you really can't be late for the test (their faces). You manage to squeeze into your assigned TestPod right before its doors slide to a close. You congratulate yourself on avoiding the punishment of yet another costly review year.</p>

<p>A biometric scan fades into the yellow-tinted display that reminds you of a sunset stuck in time. They say it's that color because it's better for your eyes, not because it's an older model used for students from the UnDisrupted, and covered in the same grain and grit as rest of the desert city you've lived in for your whole life.</p>

<p>You imagine Timi's broad and radiant face when you can finally tell him you've passed this time, and for a brief second you feel your pores spasm open, releasing precious liquid, as the memory of his body comes to mind. Your first Sweat in this never ending dry heat. You make a pattern on your HeldHand for Timi, a shape both of you had decided would communicate a thought about the other.</p>

<p>Test now, celebrate later, you chide. The Pod rattles off the familiar reminders:</p>

<p>Do not under any circumstances, leave the TestPod.</p>
<p>If you need to perform a bodily function, your SandBox is readily accessible and more importantly, readily disposable, from a sliding panel under your feet.</p>
<p>You will be judged on your ability to code collaboratively and figure out a programmatic solution.</p>
<!-- <p>Completion of the yearly OpenDarwin exam is defined as finishing the assigned problem as a team, with each member contributing roughly the same amount of code to solve the problem.</p> -->
<p>You will only communicate using the utility window of your Terminal.</p>

<p>If you are to pass the test, you will be given a Data position at a local NeighborhoodWatch center effective tomorrow.</p>
