<h4>The Qualified Life</h4>
<p class="date">2014</p>

<p>The Qualified Life is an interactive installation that imagines the future of the workplace as a fully automated and gamified system that entrusts algorithms to determine the qualifications of employment.</p>

<p>The player is introduced to Taylor Health, a startup looking to recruit talent, and begins the interview process by entering a name. The interview software finds the player through social media and begins to describe the bizarre steps they must complete.</p>

<p>The project interrogates the relationship between ergonomics and corporate wellness as forms of organizational science used to maintain, leverage, and monetizing the health of a workforce, and its resulting productivity: post-industrial Taylorism.</p>
