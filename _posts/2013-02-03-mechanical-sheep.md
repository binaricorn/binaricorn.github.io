<h4>Do Mechanical Turks Dream of Mechanical Sheep</h4>
<p class="date">2013</p>

<p>Do Mechanical Turks Dream of Mechanical Sheep is an interrogation into the subjectivity and global impact of distributed crowd-sourced technology, its role in setting a precedent for digital labor ethics, and specifically, the “artificial artificial intelligence” of Amazon Mechanical Turk. In 2013, I purchased the Google search histories of forty Amazon Mechanical Turkers, paying $0.10 per submission. This project is a reflection upon the subjection of innale malayalam serial delhi temperature digital workers from developing countries to a commodfication of their time spent online. I created an algorithm that mapped an image to each of their searches in an attempt to paint a picture of their identities, habits and desires through their search histories.</p>
