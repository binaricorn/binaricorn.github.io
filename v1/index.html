				<p>As it is you barely fit behind inside the testing booth. There’s something really weird about trying to fit your third trimester stomache into a school desk from 50 years ago, while the modern illunation of a projected screen hovers before your face. You take a minute to dial up the antinausea band around your wrist, feel its shape shifting around your pulse. hormone control? why do women have hormones? is it to gear up for pregnancy? You’re the only pregnant one in the room but you don’t expect anyone to spare you a glance.</p>

				<p>The classroom’s public access terminal keyboards usually smell like anxiety and hunger underneath the coating of yellow sand. </p>

				<p>You see just one folder titled 542DK7854. This combination of letters and numbers so familiar to you - a scrambled version of your social security number - is the Distributed Resilience account assigned to you the a few years ago when you started high school, The same one you’ve struggled with ever since you’ve had to turn in all your assignments using it, and couldn’t keep up.</p>

				<p>This is the directory where Git will be initialized. You remember the command <code>git init</code> and type it into the glowing interface.</p>

				<!-- <p>You’ve been learning the concepts of Collaborative Social Maintenance and now’s the time for you to demonstrate what you know. In this exam, you must demonstrate the ability to collaboratively navigate a real world Distributed Resilience scenario. Distributed because there are eyes everywhere,  resillient for that same reason. No need to illustrate best practices. The Neighborhood Watch Sanitation Department. You are a smoothly functioning santitation factory line. You’re to review the data, make note of anything that stands out to you or seems out of place, label it and pass it on to your teammate.

				

				

				<p>It’s also the primary reason you’re in this shithole now, because you never ever got good at the system, even had to repeat some grades because you just couldn’t figure out how to turn in your homework. You take a minute to refresh your memory because there is no browser, you can’t look up anything. Your sweat feels cool and sticky.

				<p>The terminal message shows that you’ve been navigated into your folder by default. 

				<p>LITERACY.

				<p>You assume the test is outfitted with the latest in keylogging technology, and so you type deliberately to minimize errors as you know every stroke counts. No amount of mock tests can really prepare you for this. 

				<p>The default setups usually come with Git already installed. Git, synonymous with global collaboration.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>You pick at your keyboard over this command because its hard to remember. <code>ls .?*</code> to list all hidden files in your directory because you’ve learned by now that the Git files are always hidden from view. You hit ENTER.
