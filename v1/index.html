				<!-- <p>You’ve been learning the concepts of Collaborative Social Maintenance and now’s the time for you to demonstrate what you know. In this exam, you must demonstrate the ability to collaboratively navigate a real world Distributed Resilience scenario. Distributed because there are eyes everywhere,  resillient for that same reason. No need to illustrate best practices. The Neighborhood Watch Sanitation Department. You are a smoothly functioning santitation factory line. You’re to review the data, make note of anything that stands out to you or seems out of place, label it and pass it on to your teammate.

				

				

				<p>It’s also the primary reason you’re in this shithole now, because you never ever got good at the system, even had to repeat some grades because you just couldn’t figure out how to turn in your homework. You take a minute to refresh your memory because there is no browser, you can’t look up anything. Your sweat feels cool and sticky.

				<p>The terminal message shows that you’ve been navigated into your folder by default. 

				<p>LITERACY.

				<p>You assume the test is outfitted with the latest in keylogging technology, and so you type deliberately to minimize errors as you know every stroke counts. No amount of mock tests can really prepare you for this. 

				<p>The default setups usually come with Git already installed. Git, synonymous with global collaboration.</p> -->
						<!-- <p>You pick at your keyboard over this command because its hard to remember. <code>ls .?*</code> to list all hidden files in your directory because you’ve learned by now that the Git files are always hidden from view. You hit ENTER.

					<p>You really thought you were going to do this for the last time but here you are again.</p>
					<p>The Distributed Resilience Test scenario changes each time, but the keyboards of this testing facility still smell like synthetic food and anxiety. The Neighborhood Watch's Open Data Department has sponsored this session. Their logo, a white triangle, hangs on the screen, slicing the space.</p>
					<p>You meet your teammates outside for an electrolyte capsule and a fig flavored protein stick. They get younger, smarter, and smaller in stature just like everyone's computers. By now you're used to appearing aged and slow next to these types and before they even open their mouths to ask why you look so old, you tell them your past two test scores and that shuts them up. You've had to learn how to act as if you deserve to share their air, even share your code and complete these tests together.</p>
