					<p>You meet your teammates in the lobby for an electrolyte capsule and a fig flavored protein stick. Great. This year’s coding exam has negotiated a snack sponsorship.

<p>They get younger, smarter, and smaller in stature just like the electronics. 

<p>You know this smell of synthetic food and anxiety. You’re not sure if its coming from your pores, or the crevices of the Terminal you’re standing in. This smell is hard to wash from your clothes. For days you’ll wake up to it. 

<p>You all split up, in the fashion of much-practised choreography, and head to different corners of the room. You find the large black pod that bears your GitHub user handle. 

<p>Your stretched belly is already large. You shift around your organs, if you must, to make yourself fit. These pods of solitude are created to the exacting and unfeeling standards of the basement floor of the City Watch Tower database station. You get inside, you hear nothing, and see nothing save for a small patch of window.
